title: Saving and Running a Custom Docker Image with Apache2
---
<!--
🚀 **Advancing in Docker Skills: Building and Deploying a Customized Container!** I completed an exciting assignment in my DevOps course, where I deepened my Docker proficiency. The task involved saving a previously customized Docker image and launching a new container from it, mapped to a different port. This exercise not only reinforced my Docker image handling skills but also challenged me to manage container deployment effectively. Successfully completing this task demonstrated my growing expertise in Docker containerization, a key skill in modern software development.

> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Save the image created in [[Assignment 1 – Docker – I_Module 3_Devops BC = 2330070508|assignment 1]] as a Docker image 
> 2. Launch container from this new image and map the port to 81

> 4. Check if you are able to access it on the browser



**To save the image created in [[Assignment 1 – Docker – I_Module 3_Devops BC = 2330070508|assignment 1]] as a Docker image.**

First, I'll find the container ID of the container I used:
```
docker ps -a
```
<br>![[Pasted image 20231031000228.png]]

With the container ID in hand, I commit it as an image. Let's name it `ubuntu_apache`:
```
docker commit eb2219bab5ad ubuntu_apache
```
<br>![[Pasted image 20231031000424.png]]
*Confirming image was created*

---

**I launch a container from this new `ubuntu_apache` image and map the port to 81.**

```
docker run -it -p 81:80 ubuntu_apache
```

==Once executed, I am inside the container's shell.==

> Even though I'm already in the container's shell, if I ever exit and need to return, I can use:
> ```
> docker exec -it [container-id] /bin/bash
> ```

---

Then, I start the Apache2 service:
```
service apache2 start
```

---

**I open my web browser to access the Apache2 page.**

By navigating to `http://localhost:81`, I should see the Apache2 Ubuntu default page.
